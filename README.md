# Portfolio Website

## About
This is a simple one-page portfolio website made using basic **HTML5**.  
It has sections like **About, Projects, Skills, and Contact**.

## Features
- Hero section with my name and intro  
- About section with a profile image  
- Projects list (2–3 sample projects)  
- Skills shown in a table  
- Contact form with name, email, and message fields  
- Navigation links to jump between sections  

## How to Run
1. Open the `index.html` file in any browser.  
2. Replace the sample text and image with your own details.  

## Files
- `index.html` → Main page  
- `profile.jpg` → Profile picture (replace with yours)  

## Future Plans
- Add some CSS for design  
- Maybe use JavaScript for form validation
